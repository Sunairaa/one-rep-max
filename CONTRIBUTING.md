# Contributing

This is a public personal project that I felt others could learn from or just get some React development practice in. **I am looking for specific contributions, so please refer to issues created by me before coding.** If you want to go off in your own direction, you are welcome to, but there is no guarantee I will accept your pull request. You can always maintain a fork and pull updates from this repo.

## Contributing Guidelines

For your pull request to be accepted, I ask of you to please:

- Format the code before submitting. There is a `.prettierrc` file. If you aren't familiar with [prettier](https://prettier.io/), check out their [CLI docs](https://prettier.io/docs/en/cli.html).
- If you must style, please use [Tailwind](http://tailwindcss.com/docs) and avoid writing CSS.
- Test the code manually. I do not have any unit tests set up at the moment and I'd love to add Cypress e2e tests, but since they do not exist, I am not expecting them.
- Avoid arbitrary unrelated changes. If you feel strongly about it, you can make a separate issue for it.
- Don't be an asshat.

## Reporting Bugs

If you see a bug and want to let me know, that is cool. Make an issue and outline the steps required to reproduce the bug. Provide a screenshot, if you feel it would help. If the bug is related to getting the app running, it is most likely an issue on your machine. This is a [create-react-app](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) project. You may be able to find help there.
